# Turbo CSS specification

Turbo CSS is a utility first CSS ~~framework~~ programming language.

See [https://turbocss.com/](https://turbocss.com/).

It's like a framework, except the class names are dynamically compiled
to CSS either on the server or on the client.
Thus, it offers infinite possibilities and significantly faster iteration
in contrast to other CSS framworks.

This repository contains the language specification in the form of test cases.
Language specific implementations are required to import these tests,
parse and execute them.


## Implementations

Currently there is a Go and a JavaScript implementation.
The Go implementation is considered the reference implementation.
